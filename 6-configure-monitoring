/// Azure allows AKS monitoring and log analysis by providing log analytics addons, by following the instructions to deploy AKS, we added the log analytics workspace with AKS add-on to configure monitoring
/// This solution gives you insight into the performance of your cluster by collecting memory and processor metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers.

/ now we can collect logs and metrics related to nodes, controllers and pods (system pods and user pods) in Azure Monitor
/1. Select "Azure Monitor" from the left pane in the Azure portal.
/2. Under the "Insights" section, select "Containers" to see a list of all clusters that you have access to
/3. Select the "Cluster tab" at the top of the view to check the cluster utilization. Notice how this view is again a high-level view that provides you a view on the cluster, nodes, controllers, and containers

/// to have access to logs, it's mondatory to have the wright to access through kubernetes roles (Role Based Access Control)
/// we have to create a ClusterRole and bind (associate) the ClusterRole to a user in order to grant him access to view logs

/ create the ClusterRole and the ClusterRoleBinding
kubectl apply -f logreader-rbac.yaml

/1. Switch back to the AKS cluster in the Azure portal.
/2. Select Insights under Monitoring.
/3. Select the Controllers tab, and choose a container to view its live logs or event logs. For example, choose the ratings-api container. The new view allows you to debug the status of the container.
/// now we can watch live logs
